What is Object Oriented Programming?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a fundamental programming paradigm used by nearly every developer at some point in their career. OOP is the most popular programming paradigm and is taught as the standard way to code for most of a programmer's educational career.

Its relies on the concept of classes and objects. It is used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code blueprints (usually called classes), which are used to create individual instances of objects. There are many object-oriented programming languages including JavaScript, C++, Java, and Python.

The core concept of the object-oriented approach is to break complex problems into smaller objects.

Building blocks of OOP
Next, we’ll take a deeper look at each of the fundamental building blocks of an OOP program used above:

Classes

Objects

Methods

Attributes

An object is any entity that has a state and behavior. For example, a bicycle is an object. It has

States: idle, first gear, etc

Behaviors: braking, accelerating, etc.

Before we learn about objects, let's first know about classes in Java.

Classes

A class is a blueprint for the object. Before we create an object, we first need to define the class.

We can think of the class as a sketch (prototype) of a house. It contains all the details about the floors, doors, windows, etc. Based on these descriptions we build the house. House is the object.

Since many houses can be made from the same description, we can create many objects from a class.

Create a class in Java
We can create a class in Java using the class keyword. For example,

Here, fields (variables) and methods represent the state and behavior of the object respectively.

fields are used to store data.

methods are used to perform some operations.

Objects

Of course OOP includes objects! Objects are instances of classes created with specific data, for example :

We have used the new keyword along with the constructor of the class to create an object. Constructors are similar to methods and have the same name as the class

Attributes

Attributes are the information that is stored. Attributes are defined in the Class template. When objects are instantiated individual objects contain data stored in the Attributes field.

The state of an object is defined by the data in the object’s attributes fields.

Methods

Methods represent behaviors. Methods perform actions; methods might return information about an object, or update an object’s data. The method’s code is defined in the class definition.

Benefits of OOP
OOP models complex things as reproducible, simple structures

Reusable, OOP objects can be used across programs

Allows for class-specific behavior through polymorphism

Easier to debug, classes often contain all applicable information to them

Secure, protects information through encapsulation

Four Principles of OOP
The four pillars of object oriented programming are:

Inheritance: child classes inherit data and behaviors from parent class

Encapsulation: containing information in an object, exposing only selected information

Abstraction: only exposing high level public methods for accessing an object

Polymorphism: many methods can do the same task
